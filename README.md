<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Sirpa is an app for travelers to capture their journey more effortlessly. When a user creates a post, the application marks the user's current location on the map. Users can share their experiences and the locations of the places they visit. People don't want to spend too much time on their phones while traveling, so the user can write thoughts about the visited places using the speech-to-text feature.</p>

<h3>Login</h3>
<p>The app saves user ID in CoreData from Firestore database, so the login is device specific. </p>
